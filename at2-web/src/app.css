/* =========================================
   Dark mode manual toggle configuration
   -----------------------------------------
   We override Tailwind's dark variant to be driven by
   the presence of a `.dark` class anywhere earlier in
   the DOM tree (commonly placed on <html>).

   Usage:
     <html class="dark"> ... </html>
   or toggle the class dynamically via JS (ThemeProvider).

   Any utility like:
     bg-white dark:bg-black
   will switch when `.dark` is present.

   This replaces the previous explicit override strategy
   and removes the legacy dark theme overrides.
